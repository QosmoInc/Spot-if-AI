<br/>

## Overview

Recently, streaming platforms have seen a surge in AI-generated music from tools like Suno and Udio being automatically uploaded. This flood of AI content threatens the livelihood of human musicians and dilutes the music ecosystem. Our tool helps identify AI-generated tracks to promote transparency and protect artist revenues.

Spot-if-AI is a Chrome extension that analyzes whether songs on Spotify have been generated with Suno or Udio. It works by executing [SONICS](https://github.com/awsaf49/sonics) models locally on the users' machine within the browser using the ONNX runtime.

## How to install

Build the extension as described below or download it from the GitHub releases page.


Unzip the extension to a directory and with developer mode enabled use the `Load unpacked` button to load the extension from the directory. If you built the extension you can simply load the generated `dist` directory.


For more details visit [Google's official guide](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#load-unpacked) to loading unpacked extensions.

## How to use

After the extension is successfully installed, just navigate to the [Spotify Web Player](https://open.spotify.com/). Going to any song, artist, or album page should trigger the extension to display a bar that shows the models' confidence that the song has been generated using platforms such as Udio and Suno. A red bar implies that the model is confident that the song has been generated by AI, while a green bar implies a human generated song.

## How to build
#### Convert the publicly available [SONICS](https://github.com/awsaf49/sonics) model to ONNX.
Go to the `sonics-onnx-converter` directory and follow the instructions to download and convert the a given model. We currently only support the 5 second models.

#### Build the extension
Place the onnx model inside the `src/public` folder as `sonics_model.onnx`, install Node.JS and run:
- `npm install`
- `npm run build`

## How it works
Our detection model is based on the research paper [SONICS](https://github.com/awsaf49/sonics) by Rahman et al. (2025). The detection models are trained using a large dataset of songs made by humans, as well as songs generated by popular AI music generation platforms such as Suno and Udio. This is still an active area of research at the moment, but according to the latest findings, these models detect an absence of small details often left in human created music, such as small variations in timbre and rhythm, as well as both audible and inaudible artifacts created by the specific AI models, present in the final audio output. These inaudible artifacts could be thought of as model specific watermarks that each AI generator produces involuntarily. However, these artifacts may not necessarily be generalisable to each new model that releases, requiring continuous updating of these AI detection frameworks.

## Known Issues
- Spotify charts can't be handled. They have a special structure which hides the track preview links.
- Loading too many songs in a short time results in "429 Too Many Requests" which in turn causes the extension to not show any results.
- The extension supports running only one inbuilt model at a time without any customization available.
- The extension currently only analyzes 5 seconds of audio using a chunk extracted from the middle of the preview audio from Spotify. This could be improved to use multiple 5s chunks and take an average or other type of aggregation.
- As we are using the public [SONICS](https://github.com/awsaf49/sonics) model, we face the same limitations as their model. One major one is the inability to detect songs generated with newer AI models such as Suno v4.
- No loading animations are implemented at the moment.

We welcome any contributions from the community. Feel free to open a PR and we will review it as soon as possible.

## Credits
We would like to thank the team behind the [SONICS](https://github.com/awsaf49/sonics) model for open sourcing their research and models.
